# SQL-50 Challenge - Day 2: @584. Find Customer Referee

## üìù Problem Description

Given the `Customer` table, write a SQL query to find the names of customers who are **not referred by the customer with `id = 2`**.

### Table: Customer

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |

- `id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row indicates:
  - The unique ID of a customer.
  - The customer's name.
  - The ID of the customer who referred them (`referee_id`), or `null` if they were not referred by anyone.

### Expected Output

Return a table with the following column:

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| name        | varchar |

The output should contain the names of customers who meet the condition:

- `referee_id` is **not equal to 2**, or is `null`.

### Example Input and Output

#### Input

**Customer Table**:

| id  | name | referee_id |
| --- | ---- | ---------- |
| 1   | Will | null       |
| 2   | Jane | null       |
| 3   | Alex | 2          |
| 4   | Bill | null       |
| 5   | Zack | 1          |
| 6   | Mark | 2          |

#### Output

| name |
| ---- |
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |

#### Explanation

- `Alex` and `Mark` are referred by the customer with `id = 2`, so they are excluded.
- The remaining customers (`Will`, `Jane`, `Bill`, and `Zack`) either have no referee or are referred by someone other than the customer with `id = 2`.

# SQL-50 Challenge - Day 1: @1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products

## üìù Problem Description

Given the `Products` table, write a SQL query to find the `product_id` of products that are both low fat (`low_fats = 'Y'`) and recyclable (`recyclable = 'Y'`).

### Table: Products

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| product_id  | int  |
| low_fats    | enum |
| recyclable  | enum |

- `product_id` is the primary key for this table.
- `low_fats` is an ENUM of type `('Y', 'N')`, where:
  - `'Y'`: The product is low fat.
  - `'N'`: The product is not low fat.
- `recyclable` is an ENUM of type `('Y', 'N')`, where:
  - `'Y'`: The product is recyclable.
  - `'N'`: The product is not recyclable.

### Expected Output

Return a table with the following column:

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| product_id  | int  |

The output should contain the IDs of products that satisfy both conditions:

1. Low fat (`low_fats = 'Y'`)
2. Recyclable (`recyclable = 'Y'`)

### Example Input and Output

#### Input

**Products Table**:

| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

#### Output

| product_id |
| ---------- |
| 1          |
| 3          |

#### Explanation

Only `product_id` 1 and 3 satisfy both conditions: low fat (`low_fats = 'Y'`) and recyclable (`recyclable = 'Y'`).

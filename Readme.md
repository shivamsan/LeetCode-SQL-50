# SQL-50 Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **SQL-50 Challenge** repository! 🎉

This repository is dedicated to my journey of solving the **Top 50 SQL Questions** from the [LeetCode SQL-50 Challenge](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/). The goal is to enhance my SQL skills, stay consistent, and document my progress.

## 🏆 Challenge Details

- **Platform**: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- **Study Plan**: [Top SQL 50](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/)
- **Duration**: 50 days
- **Frequency**: 1 question per day

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── Day_1
│   ├── problem.md
│   └── solution.sql
├── Day_2
│   ├── problem.md
│   └── solution.sql
...
├── Day_50
    ├── problem.md
    └── solution.sql

```

- Each day's folder contains:
  - `problem.md`: 📜 The problem statement from LeetCode.
  - `solution.sql`: 💾 My SQL solution to the problem.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. I pick one SQL question from the study plan every day.
2. Solve the question and document the solution in this repository.
3. Upload the solution with a brief explanation (if needed).
